================

Update of Mozilla's Implementation of a simple side-scrolling game in canvas

You can play it at mycrazydream.net/examples/canvas-adventure/ but I haven't given thorough testing to all the browsers yet. Firefox 26, Chrome 32, and IE 10 all work. In short, modern browsers people. The browser has to fully support HTML5 to even have a chance of working. I will update as build/test continues.
